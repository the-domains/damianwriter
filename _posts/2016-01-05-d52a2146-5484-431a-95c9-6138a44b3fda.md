I will use this page to write my poems, open letters and books.

Dec 5th 2016 As this seems to be so much a blog style hp builder , I'm going to add the date to each post like this and maybe even time stamp it.

Today I'm dealing with being overwhelmed. I feel sad all day. I'm allowing this. 

5th Jan 2016 23:05 I think that it is quite possible that no-one will ever see this site, unless I advertise it... so I will treat this as my writing catharsis.
